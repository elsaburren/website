# website
This is a simple website template which I created for my business [website](https://www.promasta.com/).

This template does not use any JavaScript. It is pure html and php. 
Its style is defined in two css-files, myStyle.css (written by me) and an external library, w3.css (needs to be included by you). 

Define your own colours and styles of the classes myFoo in myStyle.css. 

Since this template's pages are php files (choice of design to include_once the tab menu and footer from separate html files instead of having to write a tab menu and a footer for each page), a php interpreter is required to display the website.

Note that the logo.png is included in myTabs.html.

Have fun!
