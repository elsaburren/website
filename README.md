# website
This is a simple website template which I created for my business.

This template does not use any JavaScript. Its style is defined in two css-files, myStyle.css (written by me) and 
an external library, w3.css (needs to be included by you). 

Defin in myStyle.css your own colours and styles of the classes myFoo.

This template's pages are php files (this allows us to include_once the tab menu and footer from separate html files). 
So to display the website, a php interpreter is required.

Note that the logo.png is included in the myTabs.html.

Have fun!
